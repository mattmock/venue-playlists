# Cost Management & Monitoring

Target: Keep total operational costs under $15/month

## Infrastructure Costs ($5-7/month)
- Primary hosting on DigitalOcean:
  - Basic Droplet ($4-5/month)
  - Consider free tier alternatives for development
- Cost Control Measures:
  - Set up cost alerts and monitoring
  - Implement resource usage tracking
  - Define auto-scaling rules and limits
  - Regular review of resource utilization

## API Usage ($5-7/month)
### OpenAI API
- Strict spending caps:
  - Set hard monthly limit
  - Implement per-request budgets
  - Track token usage patterns
- Optimization Strategies:
  - Aggressive response caching
  - Use as fallback only
  - Batch processing where possible
  - Regular prompt optimization
  - Monitor and tune token efficiency

### Spotify API
- Free tier usage:
  - Monitor rate limits
  - Implement request caching
  - Track quota usage
  - Plan for potential future pricing changes

## Domain/DNS ($1-2/month)
- Annual domain registration
- Basic DNS management
- No premium features needed initially

## Cost Tracking System
### Monthly Dashboard
- Track spending across categories:
  - Infrastructure costs
  - API usage breakdown
  - Domain/hosting fees
- Monitor usage metrics:
  - Active users
  - API calls per user
  - Cache hit rates
  - Resource utilization

### Alert System
- Set up notifications for:
  - Approaching spending limits
  - Unusual usage patterns
  - Rate limit warnings
  - Resource spikes

## Optimization Opportunities
### Regular Reviews
- Monthly cost analysis
- Usage pattern evaluation
- Optimization opportunities
- Cache effectiveness
- Resource scaling needs

### Cost per User
- Track cost metrics:
  - Total cost per active user
  - API cost per request
  - Infrastructure cost per visit
- Define sustainable growth metrics

## Emergency Measures
### Cost Overrun Prevention
- Automatic service degradation:
  - Disable AI features first
  - Increase cache durations
  - Reduce polling frequencies
- Manual review triggers:
  - Unusual spending patterns
  - Unexpected resource usage
  - API quota warnings

### Backup Plans
- Free tier fallbacks:
  - Alternative hosting options
  - Reduced feature set
  - Extended caching
- Documentation for quick implementation
